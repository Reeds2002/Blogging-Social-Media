# Blogging-Social-Media
This a website that combines social media and blogging to create a platform
for students. Users of the website can create accounts and read other users’ blog
updates on the “feed” page. There is also be a “blog” page where users can upload
new blog posts and view their previous ones.

I've used HTML and CSS to create the forms and style it. I incorporated a lot of PHP to connect and update databases to save the blogs and comments.
